# _leetCode_ Question: [13. Roman to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/)

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I, V, X, L, C, D` and `M`.

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27 is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
- X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
- C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

## Approch:

## JAVA code:

```
class Solution {
    public int romanToInt(String s) {
    int nums[]=new int[s.length()];
    for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++){
        switch (s.charAt(i)){
            case 'M':
                nums[i]=1000;
                break;
            case 'D':
                nums[i]=500;
                break;
            case 'C':
                nums[i]=100;
                break;
            case 'L':
                nums[i]=50;
                break;
            case 'X' :
                nums[i]=10;
                break;
            case 'V':
                nums[i]=5;
                break;
            case 'I':
                nums[i]=1;
                break;
        }
    }
    int sum=0;
    for(int i=0;i<nums.length-1;i++){
        if(nums[i]<nums[i+1])
            sum-=nums[i];
        else
            sum+=nums[i];
    }
    return sum+nums[nums.length-1];
}
}
```
