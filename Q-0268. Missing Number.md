# _leetCode_ Question: [268. Missing Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

## Approch 1:

- As the elements are in range of `[0, n]` use cyclic sorting to sort
- if any element is not matching with it's index, it is the missing element

**Time Complexity** = **O**(n)

## JAVA code:

```JAVA
class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        //cyclic sorting O(n)
        int i = 0;
        while (i < nums.length) {
            if (nums[i] >= nums.length || i == nums[i]) {
                i++;
            } else {
                swap(nums, i, nums[i]);
            }
        }

        for (int j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) { //O(n)
            //if the element and index don't match up, element is missing from the array;
            if (nums[j] != j) {
                return j;
            }
        }
        //if every element is matching with its index last element is missing
        return nums.length;
    }

    //swap the array element
    private void swap(int[] nums, int i, int j) {
        int temp = nums[i];
        nums[i] = nums[j];
        nums[j] = temp;
    }
}
```

## Approch 2:

- As all the element is in between [0, n] to find the missing element
- we just need to look at the difference between the sum([1,n]) = n \* (n+1) / 2 and the sum of nums in our array.

## JAVA code:

```JAVA
public class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        int sum = 0;
        for(int num: nums)
            sum += num;

        return ((nums.length * (nums.length + 1) )/ 2) - sum;
    }
}
```
