# Question: [1200. Minimum Absolute Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference/)

Given an array of **distinct** integers `arr`, find all pairs of elements with the _minimum absolute difference_ of any two elements.

Return _a list of pairs in ascending order(with respect to pairs), each pair `[a, b]` follows_

- `a, b` are from arr
- `a < b`
- `b - a` equals to the minimum absolute difference of any two elements in `arr`

## Approch:

- Sort the elements and then check difference of each pair of neighbouring elements. Because of the sort if you take any one element the minimum distance will be between it and the next element only.
- Check for min difference as we go from first, add in to result list everytime our difference == min difference. When we met new min difference we clear the result list and start a new one.

- O(nlgn) time - Onlg for sorting and On to form the result list. Space is O(1) - just several state variables.

## JAVA code:

```
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> minimumAbsDifference(int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        List<List<Integer>> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        int minDist = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            int dist = arr[i] - arr[i - 1];
            if (dist < minDist) {
                minDist = dist;
                ans = new ArrayList<>(); // not using ans.clear(), as it takes more time.
                ans.add(Arrays.asList(arr[i - 1], arr[i]));
            } else if (dist == minDist) {
                ans.add(Arrays.asList(arr[i - 1], arr[i]));
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
