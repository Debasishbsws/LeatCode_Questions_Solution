# Question: [1460. Make Two Arrays Equal by Reversing Sub-arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/make-two-arrays-equal-by-reversing-sub-arrays/)

You are given two integer arrays of equal length `target` and `arr`. In one step, you can select any **non-empty sub-array** of `arr` and reverse it. You are allowed to make any number of steps.

Return `true` if you can make `arr` _equal to_ `target` or `false` otherwise.

## Approch:

- We can observe we can convert an array to any arangement by reversing it's sub array.
- So if both array has same element we can sort it using bubble sort that is just _reversing sub array_, and get the same array both sides.
- _So the basic question is **"is there are same elements present in both of the arrays"**_

## JAVA code:

**Use another Array count** N complexity

```
class Solution {
    public boolean canBeEqual(int[] target, int[] arr) {
        int[] count = new int[1001];
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            count[arr[i]]++;
            count[target[i]]--;
        }
        for (int c : count) {
            if (c != 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

## JAVA code:

**Sort both and compare** NlogN complexity
