# Question: [1608. Special Array With X Elements Greater Than or Equal X](https://leetcode.com/problems/special-array-with-x-elements-greater-than-or-equal-x/)
  


## Approch: 
**Shorting the array is unnecessary**, as its complexity is **nLog(n)**.
we can use binary search to point to a number and use linear search to find how many elements are greater or equal to the current element
#### * Time Complexity:  O( nlog(n) ) where n is array length, *  O(logN) for binary search. *  O(n) for one linear Search. Beats 100% time


## JAVA code: 

      public static int specialArray(int[] nums) {
            if (nums.length == 1 && nums[0] > 0) {
                return 1;
            }
            int start = 0, end = nums.length;
            while (start <= end) {
                int mid = (start + end) / 2;
                int countG = 0;
                //count how many elements are greater or equal to the current element
                for (int i : nums) {
                    if (i >= mid) {
                        countG++;
                    }
                }
                if (countG > mid) {
                    start = mid + 1;
                } else if (countG < mid) {
                    end = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    return mid;
                }
            }
            return -1;
        }
