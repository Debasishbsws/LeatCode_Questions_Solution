# Question: [540. Single Element in a Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-element-in-a-sorted-array/)

<br>

## Approch

- As the array was sorted we should think about applying Binary Search
- As every element is occuring twice then we can say (0,1) (2,3) ... (even,odd) will contain the same element until there is a disturbance.
- After the element that is single an (odd,even) will caontain the same element.

1. In Binary search, if the mid is even we check if the next element is same as present
2. if it is true that means there is not a single element if the left side of the mid.
3. whit thease condition we found the element.

## JAVA code:

    class Solution {
            public int singleNonDuplicate(int[] nums) {
            int st = 0, end = nums.length-1;
            int ans= -1;
            while (st<=end){
                int mid = st + (end-st)/2;
                if (mid%2 == 0){
                    // this is for when we get to the first element , we can't check for the privious element, because there arn't any..
                    if(mid == nums.length-1) return nums[mid];

                    if (nums[mid] == nums[mid+1]){
                        st = mid+2;
                    } else {
                        ans = nums[mid];
                        end = mid-1;
                    }
                }
                else {
                    if (nums[mid] == nums[mid-1]){
                        st = mid+1;
                    } else {
                        ans = nums[mid];
                        end = mid-1;
                    }
                }
            }
            return ans;
        }
    }
