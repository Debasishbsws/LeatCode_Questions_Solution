# _leetCode_ Question: [189. Rotate Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/)

<br>

Given an array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is **non-negative**.

Example:  
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3  
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]  
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]  
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]  
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

## Approch:

- For example, nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] and k = 3,
  - first we reverse [1,2,3,4], it becomes[4,3,2,1];
  - then we reverse[5,6,7], it becomes[7,6,5],
- finally we reverse the array as a whole, it becomes[4,3,2,1,7,6,5] ---> [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].

- Reverse is done by using two pointers, one point at the start and the other point at the end, after swaping these two, pointers move one position towards the middle.

## JAVA code:

    class Solution {
        public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
            k = k % nums.length;
            reverse(nums, 0, nums.length - k - 1);
            reverse(nums, nums.length - k, nums.length - 1);
            reverse(nums, 0, nums.length - 1);
        }
        //reverse function using two pointer
        public void reverse(int[] nums, int s, int e) {
            while (s < e) {
                int temp = nums[s];
                nums[s] = nums[e];
                nums[e] = temp;
                s++;
                e--;
            }
        }
    }
