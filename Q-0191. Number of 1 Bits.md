# _leetCode_ Question: [191. Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

**Note**:

- Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 3, the input represents the signed integer. -3.

## Approch

- Taking the last bit by bitwise AND `n&1` and then unsigned right shift for next
- If the last bit is `1` increase ones count by 1 `ones++`.

- **Here `n` will be going towards `0` as the n could be negetive as well**.
  - we can't use `while(n > 0)`

## JAVA code:

<br>

    class Solution {
            public int hammingWeight(int n) {
            int ones = 0;
            while(n != 0){
                ones += n & 1;
                n >>>= 1; // unsigned right shift
            }
            return ones;
        }
    }
