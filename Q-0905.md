# Question: [905. Sort Array By Parity](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-parity/)

Given an integer array `nums`, move all the _even_ integers at the beginning of the array followed by all the _odd_ integers.

Return **any array** _that satisfies this condition_.

## Approch:

- Two pointer;
- if element is odd put it in the last pointer else let it as it is.

---

- we can also create a new array and insted of swaping we put the elements in the front or the back based on odd even condition.

Both Time complexity O(n);

## JAVA code:

```
class Solution {
    public int[] sortArrayByParity(int[] nums) {
        int j = nums.length - 1;
        int i = 0;
        while (i < j) {
            if ((nums[i] & 1) != 0) {
                swap(nums, i, j);
                j--;
            } else {
                i++;
            }
        }
        return nums;
    }

    private void swap(int[] nums, int i, int j) {
        int temp = nums[i];
        nums[i] = nums[j];
        nums[j] = temp;
    }
}
```
