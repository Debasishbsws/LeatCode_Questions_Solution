# _leetCode_ Question: [75. Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)

<br>

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

## Approch:

- zeroIndex to indicate the index where we should put 0
- twoIndex to indicate the index where we should put 2
  If current element a[i] is 0, we swap a[i] and a[zeroIndex], if a[i] is 2, we swap a[i] and a[twoIndex], if a[i] is one, we do nothing and continue to process next element.

## JAVA code:

    class Solution {
        public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
            int zeroIndex = 0, twoIndex = nums.length - 1;
            int i = 0;
            while (i <= twoIndex) {
                if (nums[i] == 0) {
                    swap(nums, zeroIndex++, i++);
                } else if (nums[i] == 2) {
                    swap(nums, twoIndex--, i);
                } else {
                    i++;
                }
            }
        }

        public void swap(int[] nums, int i, int j) {
            int temp = nums[i];
            nums[i] = nums[j];
            nums[j] = temp;
        }
    }
