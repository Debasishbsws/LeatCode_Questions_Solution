# Question: [754. Reach a Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/reach-a-number/)

You are standing at position 0 on an infinite number line. There is a destination at position target.

You can make some number of moves numMoves so that:

- On each move, you can either go left or right.
- During the ith move (starting from i == 1 to i == numMoves), you take i steps in the chosen direction.

Given the integer target, return _the **minimum** number of moves required (i.e., the minimum numMoves) to reach the destination._

## Approch:

let's say k is the smallest number with S = 1 + 2 + ... + k >= target. If S == target, the answer is clearly k.

If S > target, we need to change some number signs. If delta = S - target is even, then we can always find a subset of {1, 2, ..., k} equal to delta / 2 and switch the signs, so the answer is k. (This depends on T = delta / 2 being at most S.) [The proof is simple: either T <= k and we choose it, or we choose k in our subset and try to solve the same instance of the problem for T -= k and the set {1, 2, ..., k-1}.]

Otherwise, if delta is odd, we can't do it, as every sign change from positive to negative changes the sum by an even number. So let's consider a candidate answer of k+1, which changes delta by k+1. If this is odd, then delta will be even and we can have an answer of k+1. Otherwise, delta will be odd, and we will have an answer of k+2.

## JAVA code:

```
class Solution {
    public int reachNumber(int target) {
        target = Math.abs(target);
        int step = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        while (sum < target) {
            ++step;
            sum += step;
        }
        if (sum == target) {
            return step;
        }

        while ((sum - target) % 2 != 0) {
            ++step;
            sum += step;
        }
        return step;
    }
}
```
