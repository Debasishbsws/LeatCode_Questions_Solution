# _leetCode_ Question: [1750. Minimum Length of String After Deleting Similar Ends](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-length-of-string-after-deleting-similar-ends/)

Given a string `s` consisting only of characters `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`. You are asked to apply the following algorithm on the string any number of times:

- Pick a **non-empty** prefix from the string `s` where all the characters in the prefix are equal.
- Pick a **non-empty** suffix from the string `s` where all the characters in this suffix are equal.
- The prefix and the suffix should not intersect at any index.
- The characters from the prefix and suffix must be the same.
- Delete both the prefix and the suffix.

Return the **_minimum length_** of `s` after performing the above operation any number of times (possibly zero times).

## Approch:

- Simple two pointer approach
- Start from the start and end of the string
- If the characters at the start and end are same
  - Move the start pointer to the next character until the character at the start pointer is different
  - Move the end pointer to the previous character until the character at the end pointer is different
- Return the length of the string between the start and end pointers;

## JAVA code:

```JAVA
class Solution {
    public int minimumLength(String s) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = s.length() - 1;

        while(start < end && s.charAt(start) == s.charAt(end)){
            while(start + 1 < end && s.charAt(start) == s.charAt(start + 1)){
                start++;
            }
            while(start < end - 1 && s.charAt(end) == s.charAt(end - 1)){
                end--;
            }
            start++;
            end--;
        }
        return end - start + 1;
    }
}
```
