# _leetCode_ Question: [1208. Get Equal Substrings Within Budget](https://leetcode.com/problems/get-equal-substrings-within-budget/)

You are given two strings `s` and `t` of the same length and an integer `maxCost`.

You want to change `s` to `t`. Changing the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> character of `s` to `i`<sup>`th`</sup> character of `t` costs `|s[i] - t[i]|` (i.e., the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters).

_Return the maximum length of a substring of `s`_ that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of `t` with a cost less than or equal to `maxCost`. If there is no substring from `s` that can be changed to its corresponding substring from `t`, return `0`.

## Approch:

- find the cost of changing each character and make an array of costs
- find the maximum length of substring with cost less than or equal to `maxCost`
- return the maximum length

## JAVA code:

```JAVA
class Solution {
    public int equalSubstring(String s, String t, int maxCost) {
        int[] cost = new int[s.length()];
        for (int i = 0; i < cost.length; i++) {
            cost[i] = Math.abs(s.charAt(i) - t.charAt(i));
        }
        //Sliding Window find the max length subarray SUM(subarray) <= maxCost
        int l = 0, r = -1;
        int ans = 0;
        int currentCost = 0;
        while(r < cost.length){
            while ( currentCost <= maxCost){
                r++;
                if(r == cost.length) {
                    break;
                }
                 currentCost += cost[r];
            }
            ans = Math.max( r - l, ans);
            while (l <= r && currentCost > maxCost){
                currentCost -= cost[l++];
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
