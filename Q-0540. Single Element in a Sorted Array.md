# Question: [540. Single Element in a Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-element-in-a-sorted-array/)

You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.

Return the single element that appears only once.

Your solution must run in `O(log n)` time and `O(1)` space.

## Approch

- As the array was sorted we should think about applying Binary Search
- As every element is occuring twice then we can say (0,1) (2,3) ... (even,odd) will contain the same element until there is a disturbance.
- After the element that is single an (odd,even) will caontain the same element.

1. In Binary search, if the mid is even we check if the next element is same as current element.
2. if `true` that means there is not a single element in the left side of the mid element.
3. if not then mid could be our single element or it will be in the left of the mid, we should check further into the left.

- `fun fact iam also single as you`

## JAVA code:

    class Solution {
            public int singleNonDuplicate(int[] nums) {
            int st = 0, end = nums.length-1;
            int ans= -1;
            while (st<=end){
                int mid = st + (end-st)/2;
                if (mid%2 == 0){
                    // this is for when we get to the first element , we can't check for the privious element, because there arn't any..

                    if(mid == nums.length-1) return nums[mid];// if mid reach the last element, it is the odd element

                    if (nums[mid] == nums[mid+1]){
                        st = mid+2;
                    } else {
                        ans = nums[mid];
                        end = mid-1;
                    }
                }
                else {
                    if (nums[mid] == nums[mid-1]){
                        st = mid+1;
                    } else {
                        ans = nums[mid];
                        end = mid-1;
                    }
                }
            }
            return ans;
        }
    }
