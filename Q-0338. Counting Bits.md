# _leetCode_ Question: [338. Counting Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/)

Given an integer `n`, return an array ans of length `n + 1` such that for each `i (0 <= i <= n)`, `ans[i]` is the number of 1's in the binary representation of `i`.

## Approch :

- Brut force approch is iterate through 0 to n, and calculate bit number for each.

## complexity n\*log(n)

## JAVA code:

<br>

    class Solution {
        public int[] countBits(int n) {
            int[] ans = new int[n+1];
            for(int i = 0; i <= n;i++){
                int x = i;
                while(x>0){
                    ans[i]+= x&1;
                    x = x >> 1;
                }
            }
            return ans;
        }
    }

## Appreoch

An easy recurrence for this problem is `f[i] = f[i / 2] + i % 2`.
