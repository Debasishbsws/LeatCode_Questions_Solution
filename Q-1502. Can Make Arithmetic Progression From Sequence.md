# Question: [1502. Can Make Arithmetic Progression From Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/can-make-arithmetic-progression-from-sequence/)

A sequence of numbers is called an **arithmetic progression** if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

Given an array of numbers `arr`, _return `true` if the array can be rearranged to form an arithmetic progression_. Otherwise, _return `false`_.

## Approch:

- **if it can be rearranged as a arithmetic pregression, it we be same as if we sort the array**.
- **1st** Sort teh array.
- **Now** if all the consecutive element has the same diffrence between them, return true, eles return false;

## JAVA code:

```
class Solution {
    public boolean canMakeArithmeticProgression(int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int diff = arr[1] - arr[0];
        for(int i = 2; i < arr.length; i++){
            if(arr[i] - arr[i-1] != diff){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
