# Question: [350. Intersection of Two Arrays II](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays-ii/)
  
Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must be unique and you may return the result in **any order**.

## Approch 1: 
* Take a count array and count the occurence in first array.
* Then check for the 2nd array is item has occured in 1st array;
## JAVA code:
  

    class Solution {
        public int[] intersect(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
            List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
            int[] count = new int[1001];
            // point out the variables present in nums1;
            for (int i : nums1) {
                count[i]++;
            }
            for (int i : nums2) {
            // if nums2 variable is alredy present in nums1, add it to the ans

                if (count[i]-- > 0) { // marked the position as 1 less as it is already in the Answer List for this time
                    list.add(i);
                }
            }
            //convert List into int[];
            int[] ans = new int[list.size()];
            int x = 0;
            for (int i : list) {
                ans[x++] = i;
            }
            return ans;
        }
    }
