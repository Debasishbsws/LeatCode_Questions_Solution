# _leetCode_ Question: [442. Find All Duplicates in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-duplicates-in-an-array/)

Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` where all the integers of `nums` are in the range `[1, n]` and each integer appears **once** or **twice**, return an array of all the integers that appears **twice**.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and uses only constant extra space.

## Approch:

- try to use index sort with some modifiaction.
- if current element's proper index is already filled with the element, that means it appears twice.
- we put it in `ans` & made it negative, and move ahead.
- if element is in its proper index or it is negative, we can skip it.

## JAVA code:

```
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        int i = 0;
        while(i < nums.length){
            if(nums[i] - 1 == i || nums[i] < 0){
                i++;
            } else{
                if(nums[nums[i] - 1] == nums[i]){
                    ans.add(nums[i]);
                    nums[i] *= -1;
                    i++;
                } else{
                swap(nums,i,nums[i]-1);
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
    private void swap(int[] arr, int i, int j){
        int temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[j];
        arr[j] = temp;
    }
}
```
