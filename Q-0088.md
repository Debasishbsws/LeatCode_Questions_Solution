# Question: [88. Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

**Merge** `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

## Approch 1:

- point to the `0th` index of both `nums1` and `nums2`
- compare them pick the smallest;
- put all the remaining items of `nums1` 1 index asid
- put the picked element in the position & increase the pointers;

## JAVA code:

```
class Solution {
    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {
        int ansPointer = 0;
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;

        while (j < m && i < n) {
            if (nums1[ansPointer] <= nums2[i]) {
                ansPointer++;
                j++;
            } else {
                for (int k = nums1.length - 2; k >= ansPointer; k--) {
                    nums1[k + 1] = nums1[k];
                }
                nums1[ansPointer++] = nums2[i++];
            }
        }

        while (i < n) {
            nums1[ansPointer++] = nums2[i++];
        }
    }
}
```
