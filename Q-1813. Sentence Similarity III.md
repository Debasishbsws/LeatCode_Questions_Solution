# _leetCode_ Question: [1813. Sentence Similarity III](https://leetcode.com/problems/sentence-similarity-iii/)

A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. For example, `"Hello World"`, `"HELLO"`, `"hello world hello world"` are all sentences. Words consist of **only** uppercase and lowercase English letters.

Two sentences `sentence1` and `sentence2` are similar if it is possible to insert an arbitrary sentence **(possibly empty)** inside one of these sentences such that the two sentences become equal. For example, `sentence1 = "Hello my name is Jane"` and `sentence2 = "Hello Jane"` can be made equal by inserting `"my name is"` between `"Hello"` and `"Jane"` in `sentence2`.

Given two sentences `sentence1` and `sentence2`, _return `true` if `sentence1` and `sentence2` are similar. Otherwise, return `false`_.

## Approch:

- two pointers, one for each sentence.
- we compare the first & last word of each sentence.
- if they are equal, we move the pointers to the next word.
- after loop is over we check if the pointers has cross each other or not;

## JAVA code:

```JAVA
class Solution {
    public boolean areSentencesSimilar(String sentence1, String sentence2) {
        String[] str1 = sentence1.split(" ");
        String[] str2 = sentence2.split(" ");
        if (str1.length < str2.length) {
            return helper(str1, str2);
        } else {
            return helper(str2, str1);
        }
    }

    private boolean helper(String[] sml, String[] lrg) {
        if (sml.length == 1) {
            return sml[0].equals(lrg[0]) || sml[0].equals(lrg[lrg.length - 1]);
        }
        int lrgLast = lrg.length - 1;
        int i = 0;
        while (i < sml.length) {
            if (sml[i].equals(lrg[i])) {
                i++;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        int j = sml.length - 1;
        while (j >= 0) {
            if (sml[j].equals(lrg[lrgLast])) {
                j--;
                lrgLast--;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return j < i;
    }
}
```
