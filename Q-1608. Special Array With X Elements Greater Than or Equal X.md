# Question: [1608. Special Array With X Elements Greater Than or Equal X](https://leetcode.com/problems/special-array-with-x-elements-greater-than-or-equal-x/)

You are given an array `nums` of non-negative integers. `nums` is considered **special** if there exists a number `x` such that there are exactly `x` numbers in `nums` that are **greater than or equal to** `x`.

Notice that `x` **does not** have to be an element in `nums`.

Return `x` if the array is special, otherwise, return `-1`. It can be proven that if `nums` is special, the value for `x` is unique.

## Approch:

**Shorting the array is unnecessary**, as its complexity is **nLog(n)**.
we can use binary search to point to a number and use linear search to find how many elements are greater or equal to the current element

#### _ Time Complexity: O( nlog(n) ) where n is array length, _ O(logN) for binary search. \* O(n) for one linear Search. Beats 100% time

## JAVA code:

      public static int specialArray(int[] nums) {
            if (nums.length == 1 && nums[0] > 0) {
                return 1;
            }
            int start = 0, end = nums.length;
            while (start <= end) {
                int mid = (start + end) / 2;
                int countG = 0;
                //count how many elements are greater or equal to the current element
                for (int i : nums) {
                    if (i >= mid) {
                        countG++;
                    }
                }
                if (countG > mid) {
                    start = mid + 1;
                } else if (countG < mid) {
                    end = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    return mid;
                }
            }
            return -1;
        }
