# Question: [55. Jump Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/)
  

You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.
<br>

## Approch:
* For every element find the maximum index we can jump to.  
If any place we find **0** that mean we can't go aheade from here.
* We have to skip this index. if MaxPos is greter than the zero element index, we can go beyond that zero, If not we can't go aheade so return **False**. 

## JAVA code:
<br>

    class Solution {
        public boolean canJump(int[] nums) {
            int maxPos = 0;

            for (int i = 0; i < nums.length-1; i++) {
                maxPos = Math.max(maxPos, nums[i] + i);
                if (nums[i] == 0 && maxPos <= i) {
                    return false;
                }
            }

            return true;
        }
    }
