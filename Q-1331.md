# Question: [1331. Rank Transform of an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/rank-transform-of-an-array/)

Given an array of integers `arr`, replace each element with its rank.

The rank represents how large the element is. The rank has the following rules:

- Rank is an integer starting from 1.
- The larger the element, the larger the rank. If two elements are equal, their rank must be the same.
- Rank should be as small as possible.

## Approch:

- Copy `arr` into `A` and sort it.
- Iterate sorted array `A` and record the rank for each element in hashmap `rank`.
- Iterate arr again, and assign `rank[arr[i]] to A[i]`.
- return the final result `A`.

**Time O(NlogN)**
**Space O(N)**

## JAVA code:

```
class Solution {
    public int[] arrayRankTransform(int[] arr) {
        int[] A = Arrays.copyOf(arr, arr.length);
        Arrays.sort(A);
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> rank = new HashMap<>();
        for (int x : A)
          rank.putIfAbsent(x, rank.size() + 1);
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; ++i)
          A[i] = rank.get(arr[i]);
        return A;
    }
}
```
