# _leetCode_ Question: [1759. Count Number of Homogenous Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-homogenous-substrings/)

Given a string `s`, return the number of homogenous substrings of `s`. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10`<sup>`9`</sup>` + 7`.

A string is **homogenous** if all the characters of the string are the same.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

## Approch:

- Find the number of consecutive characters
  - les say `aabbbcdddd`, consecutive characters are `aa`, `bbb`, `c`, `dddd`
- Calculate the number of substrings with all the same characters `(one * (one + 1)) / 2`
  - from `aa` as len is `2` we can have `2 * (2 + 1) / 2 = 3` substrings
  - from `bbb` as len is `3` we can have `3 * (3 + 1) / 2 = 6` substrings
  - from `c` as len is `1` we can have `1 * (1 + 1) / 2 = 1` substrings
  - from `dddd` as len is `4` we can have `4 * (4 + 1) / 2 = 10` substrings
- Add the number of substrings to the answer

## JAVA code:

```JAVA
class Solution {
    public int countHomogenous(String s) {
        final int M = 1000000007;
        int ans = 0;
        int count = 1;

        int i = 0;
        while (i < s.length()){
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            i++;
            while (i < s.length() && s.charAt(i) == c){
                count++;
                i++;
            }
            ans += ( count * (count + 1)) / 2;
            ans %= M;
            count = 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
