# _leetCode_ Question: [58. Length of Last Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/)

Given a string `s` consisting of words and spaces, return the _length of the **last** word in the string_.

- A **word** is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

## Approch:

- start form last character and and move forward until it is not a space.
- star count ans from that character and move forward until it is a space.
- return ans;

## JAVA code:

```
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
        int i = s.length() - 1;
        while(i >= 0 && s.charAt(i) == ' '){
            i--;
        }
        int ans = 0;
        while(i >= 0 && s.charAt(i) != ' '){
            ans++;
            i--;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
