# _leetCode_ Question: [686. Repeated String Match](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-string-match/)

Given two strings `a` and `b`, return the minimum number of times you should repeat string `a` so that string `b` is a substring of it. If it is impossible for `b`​​​​​​ to be a substring of `a` after repeating it, return `-1`.

**Notice:** string `"abc"` repeated 0 times is `""`, repeated 1 time is `"abc"` and repeated 2 times is `"abcabc"`.

## Approch:

- The idea is to keep string builder and appending until the length A is greater or equal to B.
- then check if B is a substring of A or not;
- if not then again append A one time and check again;
- now if B is a substring of A then return the count of times A is appended else retirn `-1`;

## JAVA code:

```JAVA
class Solution {
    public int repeatedStringMatch(String A, String B) {
        int count = 0;
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while (sb.length() < B.length()) {
            sb.append(A);
            count++;
        }
        if (sb.toString().contains(B))
            return count;
        if (sb.append(A).toString().contains(B))
            return ++count;
        return -1;
    }
}
```
