# _leetCode_ Question: [645. Set Mismatch](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-mismatch/)

You have a set of integers `s`, which originally contains all the numbers from `1 to n`. Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in s got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number.

You are given an integer array `nums` representing the data status of this set after the error.

Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return _them in the form of an array_.

## Approch:

- Mark all the index of the array as negative.
- if it is already marked as negative, that means we have our duplicate number. put it in ans, and let it be negative.
- At end iterate the array, only positive number remaining index+1 is the missing number.

## JAVA code:

```
class Solution {
    public int[] findErrorNums(int[] nums) {
        int[] ans = new int[2];
        for (int n : nums) {
            int i = Math.abs(n) - 1;
            if (nums[i] < 0) {
                ans[0] = i + 1;
            } else {
                nums[i] *= -1;
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > 0) {
                ans[1] = i + 1;
                break;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
