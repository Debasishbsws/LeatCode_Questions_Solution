# _leetCode_ Question: [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

## Approch 1:

JUST SEE THE CODE

## JAVA code:

```JAVA
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int c = target-nums[i];
            for (int j = i+1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                if (nums[j] == c){
                    return  new int[]{i,j};
                }
            }
        }
        return new int[]{};
    }
}
```

## Approch 2:

- This function iterates through the array and stores the values and indices in a map. For each element, it checks if the complement of the target (i.e., target - nums[i]) is in the map. If it is, the function returns the indices of the two numbers. If no solution is found, it returns an empty array.

- This solution has a time complexity of O(n), since it only needs to iterate through the array once. It also has a space complexity of O(n), since it stores all the values and indices in the map.

- Note that this solution assumes that there is exactly one solution and that you may not use the same element twice. It also allows you to return the answer in any order.

## JAVA code:

```JAVA
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    // Create a map to store the values and indices of the array
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        // Check if the complement is in the map
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            // Return the indices of the two numbers
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        // Add the current value and index to the map
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    // If no solution is found, return an empty array
    return new int[0];
}

```
