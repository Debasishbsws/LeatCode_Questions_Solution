# _leetCode_ Question: [925. Long Pressed Name](https://leetcode.com/problems/long-pressed-name/)

Your friend is typing his `name` into a keyboard. Sometimes, when typing a character `c`, the key might get long pressed, and the character will be typed 1 or more times.

You examine the `typed` characters of the keyboard. Return `true` if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.

## Approch:

- Use two pointers to traverse the `name` and `typed` strings.
- If the characters at the current index of both strings are equal, increment both pointers.
- If the characters at the current index of both strings are not equal, check if the character at the current index of `typed` is equal to the character at the previous index of `name`.
- If yes, increment the pointer of `typed` only.
- If no, return false.

## JAVA code:

```
class Solution {
    public boolean isLongPressedName(String name, String typed) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        while (i < name.length() && j < typed.length()) {
            if (name.charAt(i) == typed.charAt(j)) {
                i++;
                j++;
            }
            else if (i > 0 && typed.charAt(j) == name.charAt(i - 1)) {
                j++;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }

        while(j < typed.length() && typed.charAt(j) == name.charAt(i-1)){
            j++;
        }
        if(i != name.length() || j != typed.length()){
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
