# Question: [1122. Relative Sort Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/relative-sort-array/)

Given two arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, the elements of `arr2` are distinct, and all elements in `arr2` are also in `arr1`.

Sort the elements of `arr1` such that the relative ordering of items in `arr1` are the same as in `arr2`. Elements that do not appear in `arr2` should be placed at the end of `arr1` in **ascending** order.

## Approch 1 (Brut Force):

- for every element of arr2 find it in arr1 and put it in the front;
- at the end sort the remaining element;
- \*\*O(n^2) complexity

## JAVA code:

```
class Solution {
    public int[] relativeSortArray(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
        int k = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr2.length; i++) {
            for (int j = k; j < arr1.length; j++) {
                if (arr2[i] == arr1[j]) {
                    swap(arr1, j, k++);
                }
            }
        }
        Arrays.sort(arr1,k,arr1.length);
        return arr1;
    }

    private void swap(int[] arr, int a, int b) {
        int temp = arr[a];
        arr[a] = arr[b];
        arr[b] = temp;
    }
}
```

## Approch 2:

- use a count array and count the element occurence in arr1;
- then see the code i dont want to write
  TODO complete it

## JAVA code:

```
class Solution {
    public int[] relativeSortArray(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
        int[] count = new int[1001];
        for (int n : arr1) {
            count[n]++;
        }
        int[] ans = new int[arr1.length];
        int k = 0;
        for (int n : arr2) {
            while (count[n] > 0) {
                ans[k++] = n;
                count[n]--;
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < count.length;i++) {
            while (count[i] > 0) {
                ans[k++] = i;
                count[i]--;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
