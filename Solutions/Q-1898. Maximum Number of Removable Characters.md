# _leetCode_ Question: [1898. Maximum Number of Removable Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-removable-characters/)

You are given two strings `s` and `p` where `p` is a subsequence of `s`. You are also given a distinct 0-indexed integer array `removable` containing a subset of indices of `s` **(`s` is also 0-indexed)**.

You want to choose an integer `k (0 <= k <= removable.length)` such that, after removing k characters from `s` using the first k indices in `removable`, `p` is still a subsequence of `s`. More formally, you will mark the character at `s[removable[i]]` for each `0 <= i < k`, then remove all marked characters and check if `p` is still a subsequence.

Return the maximum `k` you can choose such that `p` is still a subsequence of `s` after the removals.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

## Approch Bruteforce: TLE

- convert the string `s` to char array
- start removing characters by `removable` array from the string `s` by replacing them with `0`
- check if the string `p` is subsequence of the string `s` after removing the characters
- if it is subsequence then increase the answer by 1
- else break the loop
- return the answer

## JAVA code Bruteforce: TLE

```JAVA
class Solution {
    public int maximumRemovals(String s, String p, int[] removable) {
        char[] str = s.toCharArray();
        int ans = 0;
        for (int r : removable) {
            str[r] = '0';
            if (isSubSequence(str, p)) {
                ans++;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }

    private boolean isSubSequence(char[] s, String p) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < s.length && j < p.length()) {
            if (s[i] == p.charAt(j)) {
                j++;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return j == p.length();
    }
}
```

## Approch 2:

- convert the string `s` to char array
- use binary search to find the maximum number of removable characters
- start removing characters by `removable` array from the string `s` by replacing them with `0`
- check if the string `p` is subsequence of the string `s` after removing the characters
- if it is subsequence then ans = mid and start = mid + 1;
- return ans + 1

```JAVA
class Solution {
    public int maximumRemovals(String s, String p, int[] removable) {
        char[] str = s.toCharArray();
        int start = 0, end = removable.length - 1;
        int sFrom = 0, ans = -1;
        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = (start + end) / 2;
            for (int i = sFrom; i <= mid; i++) {
                str[removable[i]] = '0';
            }
            if (isSubSequence(str, p)) {
                start = mid + 1;
                sFrom = start;
                ans = mid;
            } else {
                str = s.toCharArray();
                end = mid - 1;
                sFrom = 0;
            }
        }
        return ans + 1;
    }

    private boolean isSubSequence(char[] s, String p) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < s.length && j < p.length()) {
            if (s[i] == p.charAt(j)) {
                j++;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return j == p.length();
    }
}
```
