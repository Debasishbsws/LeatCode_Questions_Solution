# _leetCode_ Question: [509. Fibonacci Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/)

The **Fibonacci numbers**, commonly denoted `F(n)` form a sequence, called the **Fibonacci sequence**, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from `0` and `1`. That is,
`F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1`  
`F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.`

Given `n`, calculate `F(n)`.

## Approch

- We are starting form 0th number and come forword until we meet the desired output.

## JAVA code:

```JAVA
class Solution {
    public int fib(int n) {
        if(n < 2) return n;
        int a = 0,b = 1,nth =1;
        n--;
        while(n-- > 0){
            nth = a+b;
            a = b;
            b = nth;
        }
        return nth;
    }
}
```

## Recursive approch

- Don't use tihs this is slower
- Fibo(n) = Fibo(n-1) + Fibo(n-2);
- we just made a recursive call

```JAVA
class Solution{

    public int fib(int n) {
        if(n < 2) return n;// break point

        return fib(n-1)+fib(n-2);
    }
}
```

## Formula Approach
- Using Binet's formula **F(n) = [Phi<sup>n</sup> – (phi)<sup>n</sup>] / Sqrt[5]**. where _Phi = (1 + Sqrt[5]) / 2_ is the so-called golden mean, _phi = (1 – Sqrt[5]) / 2_ is an associated golden number,
- This approach will decrease the time complexity to O(1)

```JAVA
class Solution{
    public int fib(int n) {
        return (int) (Math.pow(((1 + Math.sqrt(5)) / 2), n) / Math.sqrt(5));
    }
}
```
