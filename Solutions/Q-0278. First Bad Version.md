# _leetCode_ Question: [278. First Bad Version](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/)

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

## JAVA code:

<br>

    /* The isBadVersion API is defined in the parent class VersionControl.
      boolean isBadVersion(int version); */

    public class Solution extends VersionControl {
        public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
            int start = 0, end = n;
            while (start <= end) {
                int mid = start - (start - end) / 2;
                if (isBadVersion(mid)) {

                    end = mid - 1;
                } else{
                    start = mid + 1;
                }
            }
            return start;
        }
    }
