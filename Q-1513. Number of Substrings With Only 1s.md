# _leetCode_ Question: [1513. Number of Substrings With Only 1s](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-substrings-with-only-1s/)

Given a binary string `s`, return the number of substrings with all characters `1`'s. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10`<sup>`9`</sup>` + 7`.

## Approch:

if we have two consecutive 1's then we can have 3 substrings with all 1's,
with 3 1's we can have 6 substrings with all 1's,
with 4 1's we can have 10 substrings with all 1's,
with n 1's we can have n(n+1)/2 substrings with all 1's.

- find all the consecutive 1's and their length
- calculate the number of substrings with all 1's `(one * (one + 1)) / 2`
- add the number of substrings to the answer
- return the answer

## JAVA code:

```JAVA
class Solution {
    public int numSub(String s) {
        final int M = 1000000007;
        long ans = 0L;
        long one = 0L;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if(s.charAt(i) == '0'){
                ans += ( one * (one + 1)) / 2;
                ans %= M;
                one = 0;
            } else {
                one++;
            }
        }
        ans += ( one * (one + 1)) / 2;
        return (int) ans % M;
    }
}

```
