# _leetCode_ Question: [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

## Approch:

JUST SEE THE CODE

## JAVA code:

```JAVA
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int c = target-nums[i];
            for (int j = i+1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                if (nums[j] == c){
                    return  new int[]{i,j};
                }
            }
        }
        return new int[]{};
    }
}
```
