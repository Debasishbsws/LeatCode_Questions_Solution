# Question: [1051. Height Checker](https://leetcode.com/problems/height-checker/)

A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line.

You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).

Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].

## Approch 1:

- Sort the array
- check which elements were not in the position

  **O(nlogn) for Sorting**

## Approch 2:

- Counting sort approch almost
- find any heights correct positions if it is not there count it to answer

  **O(n)**

### [Intresting Approch on Leetcode Discussion](<https://leetcode.com/problems/height-checker/discuss/300472/Java-0ms-O(n)-solution-no-need-to-sort>)

## JAVA code:

```
class Solution {
    public int heightChecker(int[] heights) {
        int ans = 0;
        int[] count = new int[101];
        int[] lastPos = new int[101];
        for (int i = 0; i < heights.length; i++) {
            count[heights[i]]++;
        }
        lastPos[0] = count[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < count.length; i++) {
            lastPos[i] = count[i] + lastPos[i - 1];
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < heights.length; i++) {
            int height = heights[i];
            int lp = lastPos[height] - 1;
            int fp = lastPos[height] - count[height];
            if (i < fp || i > lp) {
                ans++;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```
